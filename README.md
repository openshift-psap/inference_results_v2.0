# How to run MLPerf Inference Edge on MicroShift
We will be using the Nvidia-optimized Inference for Edge implementation from MLPerfâ„¢ v2.0.

## Prerequisites
The host system needs to be configured so that containers run on MicroShift can access GPUs.
 - Install RHEL 8.7 and MicroShift 4.12 on the host machine
 - A30 Nvidia GPU on your host machine.
 - Install the NVIDIA GPU driver 
 - Install NVIDIA Container Toolkit
 - Install NVIDIA Device Plugin



### Download the datasets for MLPerf Inference Edge 2.0:

Please refer to [/closed/NVIDIA](closed/NVIDIA/README.md) for detailed instructions on how to download the data and preprocess it.

### Start the container interactively and run script to add your system to the 'KnownSystem' list

To start the container interactively run 
```bash
oc apply -f mlperf_inferencev20_setup.yaml
```

Connect to the running container ```oc rsh  mlinferencesetup```

From inside the container run the following to add your system to the 'KnownSystem' list 

```python3 scripts/custom_systems/add_custom_system.py```
 

## Run the MLPerf v2.0 Inference Edge Benchmarks
